      <p>
        Thank you for using Nalda!
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information across the Nalda Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see an undefined term in this Privacy Policy (such as “Listing” or “Nalda Platform”), it has the same definition as outlined in our Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        When this policy mentions “Nalda,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to Nalda that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you reside in the United States, the entity responsible for data control is Nalda
        </li>
        <li>
          If you reside outside of the United States and the People’s Republic of China (for purposes of this Privacy Policy, the People’s Republic of China does not include Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) (“China”), there exists no entity that controls data yet
        </li>
      </ul>
      <strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>
      <p>
        There are three general categories of information we collect.
      </p>
      <strong>
        1.1 Information You Give Us.
      </strong>
      <p>
        We collect information you share with us when you use Nalda’s platform.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Account Information. When you sign up for an Nalda Account, we require certain information such as your name, email address, date of birth, and location.
        </li>
        <li>
          Profile Information. To use certain features within the Nalda platform, we may also ask you to complete a profile, which may include your address, phone number, and gender. Certain parts of your profile (like your profile picture, first name, and description) are a part of your public profile page, and will be publicly visible to others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other Authentication-Related Information. To help create and maintain a trusted environment, we may collect identification (like a photo of your government-issued ID) or other authentication information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Communications with Nalda. When you communicate with Nalda, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other Information. You may otherwise choose to provide us information when you fill in a form, conduct a search, update or add information to your Nalda Account, respond to surveys, post to community forums, participate in promotions, or use other features of the Nalda Platform.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <strong>
        1.2 Information We Automatically Collect from Your Use of the Nalda Platform.
      </strong>
      <p>
        When you use the Nalda Platform, we collect information about the services you use and how you use them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Usage Information. We collect information about your interactions with the Nalda Platform, such as the pages or other content you view, your searches for Listings, and other actions on the Nalda Platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          Location Information. When you use certain features of the Nalda Platform, we may collect different types of information about your general location (e.g. IP address, zip code) or more specific location information (e.g. precise location from your mobile GPS). Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s settings menu.
        </li>
        <li>
          Log Data. We automatically collect log information when you use the Nalda Platform, even if you have not created an Nalda Account or logged in. That information includes, among other things: details about how you’ve used the Nalda Platform (including links to third party applications), IP address, access times, hardware and software information, device information, device event information (e.g., crashes, browser type), and the page you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Nalda Platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cookies and Similar Technologies. We use cookies and other similar technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile identifiers. We may also allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on the Nalda Platform, or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf. While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <strong>
        1.3 Information We Collect from Third Parties.
      </strong>
      <p>
        We may collect information that others provide about you when they use the Nalda Platform, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Nalda Platform.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Third Party Services. If you link, connect, or login to your Nalda Account with a third party service (e.g., Facebook, Google, WeChat), the third party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other Sources. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third party service providers and/or partners, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results or fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts.
